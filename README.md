This project explores and quantitatively analyzes various aspects of cache and memory hierarchy in modern computers through a series of experiments. The experiments investigated: (1) the read/write latency of cache and main memory under zero queuing delay, (2) the maximum bandwidth of main memory across different data access granularities (64B, 256B, 1024B) and read/write intensity ratios (read-only, write-only, 70:30, 50:50), (3) the trade-off between read/write latency and throughput in memory, demonstrating queuing theory predictions, (4) the impact of cache miss ratio on software speed performance during light computations (matrix multiplication), and (5) the impact of TLB miss ratio on software speed performance using similar matrix-based computations. Each experiment provided valuable insights into how memory hierarchies affect system performance, with Python used to simulate the scenarios and analyze the results through plotting and execution time measurements.
